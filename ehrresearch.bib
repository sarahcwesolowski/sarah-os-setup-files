    abstract = "{Phenotyping patients using electronic health record (EHR) data conventionally requires labeled cases and controls. Assigning labels requires manual medical chart review and therefore is labor intensive. For some phenotypes, identifying gold-standard controls is prohibitive. We developed an accurate EHR phenotyping approach that does not require labeled controls.Our framework relies on a random subset of cases, which can be specified using an anchor variable that has excellent positive predictive value and sensitivity independent of predictors. We proposed a maximum likelihood approach that efficiently leverages data from the specified cases and unlabeled patients to develop logistic regression phenotyping models, and compare model performance with existing algorithms.Our method outperformed the existing algorithms on predictive accuracy in Monte Carlo simulation studies, application to identify hypertension patients with hypokalemia requiring oral supplementation using a simulated anchor, and application to identify primary aldosteronism patients using real-world cases and anchor variables. Our method additionally generated consistent estimates of 2 important parameters, phenotype prevalence and the proportion of true cases that are labeled.Upon identification of an anchor variable that is scalable and transferable to different practices, our approach should facilitate development of scalable, transferable, and practice-specific phenotyping models.Our proposed approach enables accurate semiautomated EHR phenotyping with minimal manual labeling and therefore should greatly facilitate EHR clinical decision support and research.}",
